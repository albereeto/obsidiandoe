This document describes what tableau pages there are, the design thinking and deliberations behind the workbooks, and how to create/edit workbooks. Additional overview will be taken to outline steps that could be taken to get off of Tableau as a dependency, as well as a brief foray of the documentation that falls under this general umbrella. This document should be the primary point of reference to help understand and debug the Tableau portion of the LASER project.
